# Poker-Project

In this project, we created a GUI that allows the user to play Five-Card Draw poker against the computer.
Five cards from a deck are randomly assigned to both the player and the computer.
Players are given the option to discard and replace up to three cards from their hand.
Both the player's hand and the computer's hand are assigned a point value that is used to compare the hands to determine a winner.
